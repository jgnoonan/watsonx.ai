It introduces Python API commands\nfor authentication using API key and prompt inferencing using WML API.\n\n**Note:** Notebook code generated using Prompt Lab will execute successfully.\nIf code is modified or reordered, there is no guarantee it will successfully execute.\nFor details, see: [Saving your work in Prompt Lab as a notebook](/docs).\n\nSome familiarity with Python is helpful. This notebook uses Python 3.10.\n\n## Notebook goals\nThe learning goals of this notebook are:\n\n* Creating an access token from the IBM Cloud personal API key\n* Defining a Python class for calling the WML Foundation Model inferencing API\n* Using the class to generate output from a provided text input\n\n# Setup\n\n## Inferencing class\nThis cell defines a class that makes a REST API call to the watsonx Foundation Model\ninferencing API that we will use to generate output from the provided input.\nThe class takes the access token created in the previous step, and uses it to\nmake a REST API call with input, model id and model parameters. The response\nfrom the API call is returned as the cell output."

Writers like Mark Twain and Toni Morrison, Walt Whitman and James Baldwin taught me something essential about our country\u2019s character. Reading about people whose lives were very different from mine showed me how to step into someone else\u2019s shoes.

It\u2019s no coincidence that these \u201cbanned books\u201d are often written by or feature people of color, indigenous people, and members of the LGBTQ+ community \u2014 though there have also been unfortunate instances in which books by conservative authors or books containing \u201ctriggering\u201d words or scenes have been targets for removal. Either way, the impulse seems to be to silence, rather than engage, rebut, learn from or seek to understand views that don\u2019t fit our own.\n\nI believe such an approach is profoundly misguided, and contrary to what has made this country great.

If America \u2014 a nation built on freedom of expression \u2014 allows certain voices and ideas to be silenced, why should other countries go out of their way to protect them? Ironically, it is Christian and other religious texts \u2014 the sacred texts that some calling for book bannings in this country claim to want to defend \u2014 that have often been the first target of censorship and book banning efforts in authoritarian countries.\n\nNobody understands that more than you, our nation\u2019s librarians.
